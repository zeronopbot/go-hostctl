# go-hostctl
Hosts file control mechanism

# Purpose
The intent of this project is to provide a simple, easy to use library to manage the contents of the *nix /etc/hosts file.
It makes no attempt or assumption to ensure entries don't overlap (as allowed by the system) but will
ensure the entries are valid, organised and formatted correctly.

# Usage
This tool can be used as both library or basic command line tool to manage or create host files. Either way the tool
requires elevated permissions to modify the file.

## Standalone Binary
